There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

function findUniq(arr) {
  let a = arr.sort()
  if (a[0] != a[1]) {
    return a[0]
  } else
    return a[a.length-1]
  }
